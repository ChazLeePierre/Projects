1. How many elements are there in each C-style character string that 
stores a family or given name for the account? Why?

The array size is set to 40 so it can store a maximum of 40 elements 
but because it is a C-style character string, a null terminator must
be included at the end of the string so practically it can store a
maximum of 39 characters.

2. Your class declares two member functions named set(...). In C, 
this would generate an error. Name the feature of C++ that allows
this.

Function overloading. You can have multiple definitions with the 
same identifier as long as the function signatures are different
from each other.

3. What have you learned in this workshop?

I learned how to use classes and objects, accessing private 
variables through public functions, and implementing Luhn's 
algorithm within the code.

Quiz 3 Reflection:

5. If you do not declare any constructor does the compiler insert 
a dummy constructor (answer: either true or false).

True 

6. The following definition returns an unmodifiable reference to
the current object. Complete the code:

const OOP244& OOP244::foo() const {
	// . . . member function logic
	return *this;
}
