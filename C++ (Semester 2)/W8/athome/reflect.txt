1. What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?

A concrete class is a normal class but an abstract base class is a class that
has at least one pure virtual function (virtual func() = 0;). It forces the 
program to not define the function in the base class, but in a derived class.

2. Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?

bool ChequingAccount::credit(double amount);
bool ChequingAccount::debit(double amount);

3. Explain what have you learned in this workshop.

In this workshop, I've learned more about polymorphism, the use of virtual functions,
pure virtual functions, and abstract base classes, and how to shadow a function.
