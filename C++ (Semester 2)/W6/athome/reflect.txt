1. Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else?

Self-assignment will cause the program to overwrite the data before it can be copied so we must
check for self-assignment in order to preserve the data.

2. List how you avoided duplication of code.

I avoided duplication of code with the use of helper functions such as the default constructor
when I wanted to make the current object into a safe empty state, the isValid function to validate
phone numbers, and the isEmpty function to check if the object is in a safe empty state.

3. List what you have learned in completing this workshop.

I learned to be careful when pverloading the assignment operator and putting the statement "*this = Contact();",
it caused an infinite loop. I also learned about using long long ints in a practical matter, and using scientific
notation in C++.
