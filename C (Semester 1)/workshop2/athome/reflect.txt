What do think is the most important thing you learned in this workshop?

There is a lot of new concepts introduced in this workshop and I think the most important thing I have 
learned from this activity was the use of the scanf() function. Being able to give the user control allows
 for an infinite amount of possibilities with what they choose to do with the program.

Why must you add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing?

The addition of the .005 value when calculating the GST owing is used to prevent rounding/truncation in cases 
such as casting a variable's data type from a floating point type to an integral type.

What is the result of a casting operation?

The casting operation is used to temporarily change the data type of a variable. It is very useful in situations 
where you would like to truncate a floating point type variable to an integral type variable so it loses it's 
decimal value.

Why do you think you were required to use the modulus operator in this workshop?

I think I was required to use the modulus operator in this workshop to differentiate the different types of methods
used to calculate operations. The same output can be reproduced using different operators but the modulus operator 
may have been the more elegant solution.
