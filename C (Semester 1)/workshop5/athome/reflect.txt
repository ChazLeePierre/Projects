1) In two or three sentences discuss the advantages of using an array of structs versus parallel arrays when dealing with related data

The advantages of using an array of structs versus parallel arrays when dealing with related data is if a programmer wanted to add another field
of related data using parallel arrays, he/she would have to declare another array which can get unorganized fast if alot of fields are required.
With an array of structures, the programmer would only have to increase the size of the array of the struct to add another field.

2) The preferred method of declaring a struct data type is in a header file. Briefly explain why. 

It is preferred to declare a struct data type in a header file for organizational purposes. If a structure declares a large amount of variables,
it can clutter up the main function so it is preferred to declare in a header file to avoid surfing through declarations rather than focusing on
the main code.
