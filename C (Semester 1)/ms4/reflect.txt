Assignment: 1
Milestone:  4

1. Briefly explain why you think this assignment has asked you to code a struct, Contact, that holds three other structs as data members.

I think this assignment has asked us to code a struct that holds other structs as data members to help organize our our structures better. In this
workshop, we only had to deal with a few structures but if it was alot of structures, we would probably want to group related structures together
and that's exactly what nested structures do.

2. What was the most difficult part of this assignment?

Personally, I found this assignment relatively easy. If I had to say that there was a difficult part, it would most likely be keeping track of the
members in the new struct, Contact, especially when derefrencing the struct members within the function definitions.

3. How long did it take you to complete Milestone 4?

It took me approximately less than an hour to complete Milestone 4. All the logic was transferred over from Milestone 2 so it was just a matter of
nesting the structs and putting all the code into self-contained functions.
