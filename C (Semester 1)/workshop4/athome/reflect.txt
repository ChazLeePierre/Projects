1) In one or two sentences explain why the arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements?

The arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements because the maximum amount of days a user can enter is 10. It is important to set the size of the array to the maximum amount of elements just incase the program needs in later.

2) In two or three sentences explain the advantages and disadvantages of using matching arrays?

An advantage of using matching arrays is that they both share the same index which makes it easier for organization. A disadvantage of using matching arrays is that there is no relationship between the arrays, so the compiler would not report an error if used wrong.

3) Was the at home portion of this workshop too easy, just right or too hard? Why? 

The at home portion of this workshop was just right as we used familiar concepts such as calculating the highest/lowest temperature like last workshop, but also introduced new concepts such as arrays and waiting until the user enters -1 to exit the program.
