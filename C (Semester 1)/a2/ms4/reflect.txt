3. Briefly explain how the two functions findContactIndex() and getTenDigitPhone() 
benefit your source code with respect to overall maintenance and readability.

The two functions findContactIndex() and getTenDigitPhone() benefit the source 
code with respect to overall maintence and readability by assisting in covering
possible edge cases entered by the user or something the program has not accounted
for. With these functions in place, the program will not continue without certain
conditions being satisfied.

4. What did you learn most from doing Assignment 2? 

By far, the most advanced concept I learned from doing Assignment 2 was utilizing 
a bubble sort algorithm as one of the features. It consists of two for loops, one
to compare the current & previous element, and another for loop to seperate the
sorted from the unsorted. This was the first algorithm in programming that went 
above my head, but eventually understood, and honestly it feels satisfying.
