1. Can you think of a more efficient way to ask a user to add the required information to each data field? 

Organizing multiple related statements into seperate self-contained modules through the use of functions. 
My program currently consists of a lot of printf and scanf statements, making the code look messy and 
unorganized. The use of functions will improve the readability of my code while ensuring a
cohesive design.

2. Explain why a C string that is required to store up to 25 characters must be capable of storing 26 
characters?

A C string that can store up to 25 characters must be capable of storing 26 characters because a C string
requires it's last element to be a null character '/0'. This null terminator has the value of zero and tells
our program that this element is the end of our char array.
