1. In 3 or 4 sentences explain the term "function" and briefly discuss the need for functions in any language? 

In relation to programming, the term "function" is a module of statements designed to perform a certain task and
pass the control to the next function when it has finished executing all the required statements in itself. The 
purpose of using functions in any programming language is to exhibit a highly cohesive design with little to no 
signs of coupling. Ideally, we would like our programs to focus on one task and that task alone before moving onto
the next without passing unneccessary data between modules.

2. Briefly explain why you think the "helper" functions are in a different module and why those functions were 
not included in the "contacts" module?

I believe we separated the "helper" functions from "contacts" module to improve our code's readability and org-
anization. Reading a lot of lines of code that all perform different tasks can feel overwhelming to a human. I
also believe we separated certain functions from others because some modules are more related to each other than 
others. For example, in the "helper" files, they all perform one common task; to help reduce redunancy in our main code. 
The "contacts" module also has functions that all perform one common task; to capture user input and store that 
data into our data structures. It is our responsibility as programmers to determine which tasks are most related
and group them together.
